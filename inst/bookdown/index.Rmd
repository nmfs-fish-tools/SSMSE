This is the user manual for SSMSE, an R package for Management Strategy Evaluation with Stock Synthesis Operating models. This document is still a work in progress! If you would like to suggest changes, the R markdown files used to generate the user manual are available in a [bookdown folder within the SSMSE repository](https://github.com/nmfs-fish-tools/SSMSE/tree/main/inst/bookdown). Please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/nmfs-fish-tools/SSMSE/issues) or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/nmfs-fish-tools/SSMSE/pulls) to suggest changes.

```{r include=FALSE}
# only show versions of very relevant packages

  lapply(c('r4ss', 'ss3sim'), loadNamespace)
  res = utils::sessionInfo()
  loaded = res$loadedOnly
  res$loadedOnly = loaded[intersect(names(loaded), c('r4ss', 'ss3sim'
  ))]
  res$BLAS = res$LAPACK = NULL

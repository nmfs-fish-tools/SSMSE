Description: An R package for performing Management Strategy Evaluation
    (MSE) using Stock Synthesis (SS). SS is used as the Operating Model
    (OM) and, if the user desires, the Estimation model (EM). SSMSE allows
    existing SS models to be used as the basis for an OM. These OMs are
    used in the MSE framework provided by SSMSE to evaluate the
    implications of management actions on a population given uncertainty.

	abstract = {The a4a approach to Management Strategies Evaluation ( MSE ) is to develop a set of common methods and procedures to build a minimal standard MSE algorithm. This has the most common elements of both uncertainty and management options. Such a tool set should allow for the development of MSE simulations for many fisheries in an operational time frame. Between the 30th of January and the 3rd of February, in Ispra, Italy, the JRC organized a workshop on development of MSE algorithms with R/FLR/a4a. The workshop was a mix of hands-on coding and discussion/implementation of concepts associated with MSEs. The participants used the most recent version of the a4a MSE code, modularized the most important processes and developed their own version of several processes so that the MSE could model and test alternative management procedures to the one initially coded.

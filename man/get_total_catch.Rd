\title{Example Performance Metric: Calculate total catch over a range of years}
\usage{
get_total_catch(datfile, yrs)
}
\arguments{
\item{datfile}{Path to the Stock Synthesis data file containing catch}

\item{yrs}{A vector containing a range of years. Years are as defined in the
Stock Synthesis data file.}
}
\value{
The total catch, a number.
}
\description{
Example performance metric that calculates total catch over a range of years
in a Stock Synthesis data file. This function aggregates catch across
fleets, so may not be appropriate for models with multiple fleets.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
total_catch <- get_total_catch(datfile = "ss3model/dat.ss", yrs = 25:100)
total_catch

\usage{
create_OM(
  OM_out_dir,
  overwrite = TRUE,
  writedat = TRUE,
  verbose = FALSE,
  nyrs = NULL,
  nyrs_assess = NULL,
  nscen = 1,
  scen_name = NULL,
  niter = 1,
  future_om_dat = NULL,

  sample_struct_hist = NULL,
  sample_struct = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{OM_out_dir}{The full path to the directory in which the OM is run.}

\item{overwrite}{Allow existing files to be overwritten?}

\item{writedat}{Should a new datafile be written?}

\item{verbose}{Want verbose output? Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{nyrs}{Number of years beyond the years included in the OM to run the
MSE. A single integer value.}

\item{nyrs_assess}{The number of years between assessments. This is used to
structure the forecast file for use in the OM.}

\item{nscen}{The scenario number}

\item{scen_name}{The scenario name}

\item{niter}{the iteration number}

\item{future_om_dat}{An optional data_frame including changes that should
be made after the end year of the input model. Including parameter variations,
recruitment deviations, and implementation errors.}

\item{verify_OM}{Should the model be run without estimation and some basic
checks done to verify that the OM can run? Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{sample_struct_hist}{An optional list including which years should be
sampled for the historical period for the data generated from the OM. If
this is left as NULL, then the same sampling scheme will be used as in the
OM's data file. If it is not NULL, then each year.}

\item{sample_struct}{A optional list including which years, seasons, and fleets
should be  added from the OM into the EM for different types of data.
If NULL, the data structure will try to be inferred from the pattern found
for each of the datatypes within the EM datafiles. Include this structure
for the number of years to extend the model out. Note that the data should
be specified using the list component names and column names as in would be
used in \code{r4ss::SS_readdat()}. The \code{run_SSMSE_iter} function
examples give an example of what this structure should be. Running the
function \code{create_sample_struct()} will also produce a sample_struct
object in the correct form. Can be NULL only when MS is not EM.}

\item{seed}{A random seed so that reproducible results are possible.}
}
\value{
A modified datafile
}
\description{
This function manipulates the OM as needed so that it can be used as an
operating model.

\usage{
SSMSE_summary_all(
  dir = getwd(),
  scenarios = NULL,
  run_parallel = FALSE,
  n_cores = NULL,
  overwrite = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dir}{Path to the directory containing the scenarios, either relative
or absolute. Defaults to the working directory.}

\item{scenarios}{A character vector of scenarios in dir from which to extract
summaries. If left as NULL, the summaries will be extracted from all folders
in dir.}

\item{run_parallel}{Option to use parallel processing on iterations.
Defaults to FALSE}

\item{n_cores}{how many cores to use if running in parallel defaults to
n_cores available - 1 (also capped at one less than the number of cores
available)}

\item{overwrite}{Allow existing files to be overwritten?}
}
\value{
A list of 3 data frames called scalar, ts, and
dq (for derived quantities). These lists contain information for
multiple model runs (estimation models and operating models) for 1
iteration.Also writes 3 .csv files with the contents of this list of
dataframes to dir and 3.csv files with scenario specific results in each of
the scenario foldurs..

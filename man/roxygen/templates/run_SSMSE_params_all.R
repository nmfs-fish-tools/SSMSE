#' @param custom_MS_source A file location with the source code for any custom MS
#'  models to be used in the simulation. SSMSE will source this file which should
#'  contain a function/s whose name/s match each custom MS models included in MS_vec.
#'  To learn more about using custom management strategies, see the 
#'  [using a Custom Management Stratey/Procedure section](https://nmfs-fish-tools.github.io/SSMSE/manual/custom-MS.html)
#'  in the [SSMSE User Manual](https://nmfs-fish-tools.github.io/SSMSE/manual).
#' @param run_EM_last_yr Should the MS be implemented to get future catch if the
#'  last year is an assessment year? TRUE/FALSE option, so the same for all 
#'  scenarios and iterations. Defaults to FALSE.

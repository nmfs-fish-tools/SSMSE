# parameters common to run_SSMSE and crate_scen_list
#' @param scen_name_vec A vector containing names of the scenarios. The each
#'  string will be a directory containing all the model runs for a scenario.s
#' @param out_dir_scen_vec The directory to which to write output. IF NULL, will
#'  default to the working directory.
#' @param iter_vec The number of iterations per scenario. A vector of integers
#'  in the same order as scen_name_vec.
#' @param OM_name_vec Names of a valid Stock Synthesis stock assessment model.
#'  To see the names of built-in models, type 
#'  \code{list.dirs(system.file("extdata", "models", package = "SSMSE"),full.names = FALSE, recursive = FALSE)}
#'  into the R console.
#' @param OM_in_dir_vec Vector of relative or absolute paths to the operating
#'  model, if using a model outside of the SSMSE package.
#' @param EM_name_vec Should be NULL unless \code{MS = "EM"}. Name of a valid Stock
#'   Synthesis stock assessment model to use as an EM. If the value of EM_name
#'   is NULL and  \code{MS = "EM"}, then SSMSE will look for the estimation model
#'   in the path specified in EM_in_dir. valid inputs for EM_name are: \code{"cod"}
#'    or \code{NULL}.
#' @param EM_in_dir_vec Relative or absolute path to the estimation model, if using
#'   model outside of the SSMSE package. Note that this value should be NULL if
#'   \code{MS} has a value other than "EM".
#' @param MS_vec Vector of management strategies. Current options are:
#'   \code{"last_yr_catch"} which uses the previous year's catch;
#'   \code{"no_catch"} which uses 0 catch; \code{"EM"} which uses an stock
#'   synthesis model as the estimation method and the management strategy as
#'   defined in the forecast file of the stock synthesis estimation method;
#'   \code{"Interim"} to modify catch based on survey predictions between
#'   assessments. Users can also specify their own managment strategies as an
#'   function. To use the function, it must be available in the global
#'   enviroment and specified by name in MS. For example, if the function is
#'   called "my_ms" then the user should make it available in the global
#'   environment and specify "my_ms" as a component of MS_vec.
#' @param use_SS_boot_vec Should a bootstrapped data set generated by SS be used?
#'   Defaults to TRUE.
#' @param nyrs_vec Number of years beyond the years included in the OM to run the
#'   MSE. A single integer value.
#' @param nyrs_assess_vec The number of years between assessments. E.g., if an
#'  assessment is conducted every 3 years, put 3 here. A single integer value.
#'  (NOTE: This could be made more flexible by instead reading in a vector of
#'  assessment years, so users could specify irregular numbers of yrs between
#'  assessments.)
#' @param sample_struct_list A optional list of lists including which years, seasons,
#'  and fleets should be  added from the OM into the EM for different types of
#'  data. If NULL, the data structure will try to be infered from the pattern
#'  found for each of the datatypes within the EM datafiles. Include this
#'  strucutre for the number of years to extend the model out.
#' @param sample_struct_hist_list An optional list of lists including which years should be
#'  sampled for the historical period for the data generated from the OM. If
#'  this is left as NULL, then the same sampling scheme will be used as in the
#'  OM's data file. If it is not NULL, then each year
#' @param interim_struct_list A optional list of parameters to control an interim assessment
#'  with an example structure below, where Beta=a positive value that is inversely proportional to risk,
#'  MA_years= the number of years to average index observations of when calculating deviations,
#'  assess_freq=the number of years between full assessments during with an interim assessment will happen
#'  every year, and Index_weights is a vector of length n indexes that weights all indexes for multi index
#'  inference.
#'  `interim_struct_list<-list(Beta=1,MA_years=3,assess_freq=5,Index_weights=rep(1,max(ref_index[,3])))`
#' @param sample_catch_vec Should catch be sampled or fixed at the OM values? 
#'   This can be a single Boolean (TRUE or FALSE) to apply to all scenarios or 
#'   a vector of the same length as the number of scenarios. Defaults to FALSE.

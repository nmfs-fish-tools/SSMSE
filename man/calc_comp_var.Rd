\arguments{
\item{data_obs}{A data frame of observed composition data extracted from SS3 .dat file}

\item{data_exp}{A data frame of the expected composition data as estimated by an SS3 assessment model}

\item{bins}{A vector object including the composition bins}

\item{fleets}{A vector of the fleet numbers to analyze composition uncertainty for (Default is all fleets if NULL)}

\title{Create the devs dataframe for a scenario and iteration from user input}
\usage{
convert_future_om_list_to_devs_df(
  future_om_list,
  scen_name,
  niter,
  om_mod_path,
  nyrs,
  global_seed = 123
)
}
\arguments{
\item{future_om_list}{An optional list of lists including changes that should
be made after the end year of the input model. Each first level list element
outlines 1 change to be made to the operating model. To see an example, try
running \code{\link{create_future_om_list}}. Defaults to NULL, which implies
that the model will be extended forward in time assuming the original model
structure.}

\item{scen_name}{The scenario name}

\item{niter}{The iteration number}

\item{om_mod_path}{Path to the OM files. Used to reference parameter names.}

\item{nyrs}{The total number of years that the model will be extended forward.}

\item{global_seed}{A global seed to set, then pull new seeds from. Defaults
to 123.}
}
\value{
A list including 3 dataframes and one list: devs_df, the additive deviations
relative to the base values; base_df, the base values of the parameter with
deviations; abs_df, the absolute future values by year (first col) and
parameter (parameterss in different cols). Also includes a modified version
of the future_om_list which includes the seed applied to each list component
(note that this is not the ultimate seed used for sampling, as addiitonal)
seeds are generated from this seed based on the scenario, iteration, and
option for randomness (replicate across scenarios or randomize across scenarios).
Note that no OM files are modified or created as part of this function
(i.e., it does not have side effects).
}
\description{
This function parses user inputs to convert it into a dataframe of deviations.

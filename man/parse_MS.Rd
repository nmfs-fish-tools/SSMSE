\usage{
parse_MS(
  MS,
  EM_out_dir = NULL,
  EM_init_dir = NULL,
  init_loop = TRUE,
  OM_dat,
  OM_out_dir = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE,
  nyrs_assess,
  dat_yrs,
  future_om_list = NULL,
  sample_struct = NULL,
  interim_struct = NULL,
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{MS}{The management strategy to use. Current options
are:  \code{"last_yr_catch"} which uses the previous year's catch;
\code{"no_catch"} which uses 0 catch; \code{"EM"} which uses an stock
synthesis model as the estimation method and the management strategy as
defined in the forecast file of the stock synthesis estimation method;
\code{"Interim"} to modify catch based on survey predictions between
assessments. Users can also specify their own management strategies as a
function. For example, if the function is
called "my_ms" then the user should specify MS = "my_ms" and specify the
path to the file containing the function in \code{custom_MS_source}.}

\item{EM_out_dir}{Relative or absolute path to the estimation model, if using a
model outside of the SSMSE package.}

\item{EM_init_dir}{Initialization director that retains the reference files for interim assessments}

\item{init_loop}{Logical. If this is the first initialization loop of the
MSE, \code{init_loop} should be TRUE. If it is in further loops, it should
be FALSE.}

\item{OM_dat}{An valid SS data file read in using r4ss. In particular,
this should be sampled data.}

\item{OM_out_dir}{The full path to the directory in which the OM is run.}

\item{verbose}{Want verbose output? Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{nyrs_assess}{The number of years between assessments. E.g., if an
assessment is conducted every 3 years, put 3 here. A single integer value.}

\item{dat_yrs}{Which years should be added to the new model? Ignored if
init_loop is TRUE.}

\item{future_om_list}{An optional list of lists including changes that should
be made after the end year of the input model. Each first level list element
outlines 1 change to be made to the operating model. To see an example, try
running \code{\link{create_future_om_list}}. Defaults to NULL, which implies
that the model will be extended forward in time assuming the original model
structure.}

\item{sample_struct}{A optional list including which years, seasons, and fleets
should be  added from the OM into the EM for different types of data.
If NULL, the data structure will try to be inferred from the pattern found
for each of the datatypes within the EM datafiles. Include this structure
for the number of years to extend the model out. Note that the data should
be specified using the list component names and column names as in would be
used in \code{r4ss::SS_readdat()}. The \code{run_SSMSE_iter} function
examples give an example of what this structure should be. Running the
function \code{create_sample_struct()} will also produce a sample_struct
object in the correct form. Can be NULL only when MS is not EM.}

\item{interim_struct}{An optional including how many years to average over,
fleet weights, the scaling rate (Beta) of catch relative to the index change for each fleet,
and the reference year for each fleet (either a fixed year or <=0 relative to end_yr, fixed year
will stay constant during simulation while relative year will progress with simulation).}

\item{seed}{A random seed so that reproducible results are possible.}

\description{
This function matches each management strategy with its correct method. And
checks for errors.

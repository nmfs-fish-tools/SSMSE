\title{Example Performance Metric: Calculate the avg relative SSB (SSB/SSB unfished)
over a range of years for each iteration}
\usage{
get_rel_SSB_avg(summary, min_yr, max_yr)
}
\arguments{
\item{summary}{Summary returned from running \code{SSMSE_summary_all()}}

\item{min_yr}{The first year to include in the average}

\item{max_yr}{The last year to include in the average}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the relative avg SSB per year by iteration and
scenario.
}
\description{
Example performance metric that calculates the average Spawning Stock Biomass
SSB (units as in the simulations) relative to the  unfished SSB over a range
of years for each iteration of each scenario in the SSMSE simulation run.
